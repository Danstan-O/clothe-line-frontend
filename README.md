# Getting started

I was unable to deploy my backend part of the project to be hosted so you have to fork and clone the backend from:

https://github.com/Danstan-O/clothe-line-backend

## Once the backed has been set up you can then access all the fuctionalities in the front end.

## The Home page
I wanted to make sure that anyone that when someone logs into the application they can see all the clothes displayed in the app.

From here you can be able to access the other links e.g
